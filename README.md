**Open Source your Circuit Design with KiCAD**
* What: [Open Source Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org/) 2015 slides
* When: Tuesday, June 23, 2015 from 11:00 to 11:45am
* Where: The Eliot Center in Portland, Oregon

I learned to design circuits in Eagle because at the time there were no good, free, open source alternatives but I would argue that's changed. Let's talk about why KiCAD might be the CAD program you're looking for and do a whirlwind tour of the current state of KiCAD tools and community. 

**Open Hardware: From Breadboard to PCB**
* What: [Open Source Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org/) 2014 slides
* When: Thursday, June 26, 2014 from 4:45 to 5:30pm
* Where: B302/303 at the Eliot Center in Portland, Oregon

So you've built a breadboard circuit with wires everywhere. What's next? A printed circuit board! I'll talk about your open hardware development options through the lens of my recent project turning a breadboard prototype into a finished Arduino shield for a curing oven at Portland State.
